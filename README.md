# Codes
Currently I am learning JAVA, and here are various codes representing my work and understanding of that.


//Q.1 print integers from 1 to 10 using while loop

    import java.util.*;

    class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

    Scanner scn = new Scanner (System.in);
    int count = 1 ;
    while (count <= 10) {
        System.out.print (count + " ");
        count = count + 1;
    }
    }
    }
