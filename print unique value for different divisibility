# Codes
Currently I am learning JAVA, and here are various codes representing my work and understanding of that.

    /*
    Given an integer value as input 
    print fizz if it is divisible by 3
    print buzz if it is divisible by 5
    print fizz buzz if is divisible by 3 and 5 both
    */

    int x = scn.nextInt();
    if (x % 3 == 0 && x % 5 ==0) {   
        System.out.print("fizz-buzz");
    }
    else if (x % 5 == 0) {
        System.out.print ("buzz");
    }
    else if (x % 3 == 0) {
        System.out.print ("fizz");
    }
    }
    }
